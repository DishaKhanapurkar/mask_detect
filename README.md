# mask_detect
Built a face mask detecion model that uses Convolution Neural Network and Haarcascade classifier and gives an accuracy of 0.94
The dataset for this is approx 4000 images containing with mask and without mask.
Epochs are 20 and graphs of training and validation accuracy & loss are as follows

The flow of project goes as :
Data preprocessing

Training

Evaluation

Accuracy Check

Applying model in inbuilt camera

Final Result
